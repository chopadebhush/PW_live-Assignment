Enter the names of the files then open both files in read-only mode using the open() function and print the contents of the files before appending them using the read() function now close both files using the close() function. and open the first file in append mode and the second file in read mode. Append the contents of the second file to the first file using the write() function. Reposition the cursor of the files at the beginning using the seek() function. Print the contents of the appended files. and Close both files
we first open (file1) and after it, we open (file2) we open file one in read mode and file2 in append mode then copyfileobj() the function reads data from file1 in chunks and appends it to file2 until the entire content is copied
We here first open the target file2 in append mode. Then, by using fileinput.input(), we open the source file1 in read mode and iterate over its lines. and then for every line in file1, we write it to file2 using the write() method. This way work perfectly with large file to read and write data from one text file to another
